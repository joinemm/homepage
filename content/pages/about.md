# Hi, I'm <Accented text="Joonas" />

Software Engineer from Finland who is very passionate about Linux, open source software and privacy.

Currently I am working as a DevOps Engineering consultant.

My favourite and most used languages are Python, Bash, Rust, Go and Nix.

I was a longtime user of Arch Linux but recently I have seen the light and transitioned all of my machines to NixOS.

Aside from programming, I enjoy death metal, coffee, wine, photography, cooking and small electronics.
