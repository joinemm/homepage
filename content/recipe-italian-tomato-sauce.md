I found this tomato meat sauce recipe somewhere on the internet, and with slight modifications, it has become one of my go-to weekend dinners. The addition of milk into the meat tenderizes it and cuts the acidity of the whole sauce, and the additional olive oil and grated garlic flavoring right before serving elevate the taste to another level.

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 onion
- [ ] 3 garlic cloves
- [ ] 400g ground meat half beef, half pork
- [ ] ~1dl milk
- [ ] 2 cans Mutti Polpa finely chopped tomatoes
- [ ] 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] Salt and pepper
- [ ] Fresh basil
- [ ] Spaghetti (bronze cut)
- [ ] Parmesan / pecorino romano

## Instructions

Heat some olive oil in a large skillet. On medium heat, fry the finely chopped onion until translucent.

Add the ground meat and break it into smaller pieces. Turn the heat to high and add the milk, stirring until it has evaporated.

Add the tomato paste and let it brown slightly. Add the canned tomatoes, clean the cans with a little water and add that water in as well. Add 2 cloves of grated garlic (leaving 1 for later), a lot of basil leaves and some salt & pepper to taste.

Bring the sauce to a boil, turn the heat down to low, cover with a lid leaving it a bit ajar and simmer for around 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

After 20 minutes remove the lid and continue simmering for 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly. This is a good time to start cooking your pasta as it usually takes around 10 minutes to 'al dente'.

Few minutes before serving, add the remaining grated garlic, drizzle in some olive oil, add more fresh basil and stir, letting the flavors get to know each other.

Plate up, topping with shredded fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil and grated parmesan cheese. Serve with a glass of red wine.

Enjoy!
