# Stuff I <Accented text="use" />

This is the list of stuff I use to do my work and get other stuff done around the computer. If you want to see more lists like this, check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

## Software

I run some variation of Linux on all of my systems. Arch Linux was my go-to for a long time but recently I have experimented with NixOS and I'm loving it. I have converted all of my machines to daily drive NixOS by now.

I don't run any deskop environment, but instead login to the tty console and launch X11 with `startx`, which runs some scripts and starts my window manager (`xmonad`).

Xmonad is a tiling window manager, meaning all windows automatically arrange themselves to fill the screen. This is much more efficient workflow than manually moving windows around and over one another with the mouse. I also prefer using the terminal as much as possible, and favor software that has support for vim keybindings (`hjkl`).

Due to not having a desktop environment, everything has to be configured manually. I like that. I know *exactly* what my system is doing at all times and nothing is "magic".
